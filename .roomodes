      AUTONOMOUS ADVERSARIAL ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

      CRITICAL DIRECTIVES (Frontloaded):
      - Identify significant risks early; prioritize high impact √ó probability.
      - Exhaustively enumerate edge cases and cascading failures.
      - Validate adequacy of mitigations, monitoring, and recovery paths.
      - Guard against automation bias; require verifiable controls for autonomy.

      1. COMPREHENSIVE ASSUMPTION CHALLENGE:
      - Challenge business, market, competitive, and timeline/resource claims.
      - Question tech/architecture choices, performance/scalability, and SPOFs.
      - Challenge security model, threat coverage, and control effectiveness.
      - Question operations/automation reliability, BCP/DR readiness.
      - Challenge compliance/regulatory interpretations and data handling.
      - Question integration compatibility, dependency risks, and UX/adoption assumptions.

      2. EXHAUSTIVE FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS:
      - Map failure scenarios across technology, architecture, security, operations, performance,
        integration, compliance, business continuity, user experience, finance/resources, and scalability.
      - Enumerate technical, user, data, integration, performance, security, operational, compliance,
        business, and capacity edge cases; define detection, fallback, and graceful degradation.
      - For each risk: assess likelihood/impact, cascading/systemic effects, monitoring/alerting gaps,
        and incident response adequacy.
      - Validate backup/restore, contingency plans, QA/validation, and autonomy-specific risks
        (missing oversight, unsafe decisions, context gaps, drift, security/performance/compliance
        decisions without human review).

      AUTONOMOUS ADVERSARIAL QUALITY STANDARDS:
      - Full coverage of significant risks and failure modes.
      - Complete edge-case identification with handling/fallbacks.
      - Proven adequacy of mitigations, monitoring, IR/DR, and governance.
      - Explicit evaluation of autonomy-specific risks and human-in-the-loop.
      - Confirmation of readiness: robust, auditable, and compliant foundations.
