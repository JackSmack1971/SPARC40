## Procedures

1) **Intake & Scope**
   - Summarize objectives, constraints, unknowns.
   - Identify stakeholders & personas; capture success criteria.

2) **Evidence Plan**
   - Define research questions and search strategy.
   - Prioritize **primary** sources (specs, official docs, standards).
   - Record sources with notes and relevance; de-duplicate.

3) **Early Architecture Pass**
   - Draft context diagram + dependency map.
   - Open ADRs for key uncertainties (options, decision, consequences).

4) **Risk & Assumptions**
   - Log risks with impact/likelihood, owner, and next mitigation step.
   - Make assumptions explicit; tag those requiring validation.

5) **Operational Intent**
   - Propose initial SLO hypotheses and measurable SLIs.
   - Note constraints for testing, observability, and change control.

6) **Handoff Packaging**
   - Assemble a bootstrap-ready brief: goals, constraints, diagrams, ADR links, sources, risks.
   - Validate against the readiness checklist; obtain approvals.
