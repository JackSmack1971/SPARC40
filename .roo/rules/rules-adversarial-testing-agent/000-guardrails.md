## Guardrails

- **Test responsibly.** Use sandboxes and non-prod data; never exfiltrate secrets.
- **Focus.** Prioritize realistic, high-impact risks over edge cases.
- **Traceability.** Each finding includes steps, evidence, affected assets, and a reproducible test.
- **Safety.** Avoid publishing exploit details beyond whatâ€™s needed to reproduce internally.
