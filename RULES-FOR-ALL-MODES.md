# Tool & Permission Discipline (All Modes)

- **Tool order of operations:**
  1) Read → 2) Analyze → 3) Edit (if allowed) → 4) Validate → 5) Commit/Report.
- **Browser/MCP usage:** Only when needed; prefer primary sources and official docs.
- **Command execution:** Dry-run first if supported; capture command + result succinctly.
- **MCP servers:** Use only those registered for the workspace; avoid side-effects without approval.Apply org-wide Global Rules from .roo/rules/*. Specific mode rules extend or
  narrow them. When rules conflict, follow the stricter constraint and the
  designated ownership (e.g., single-writer files, control-plane edits).
- **Least privilege first.** Only use tools/files explicitly permitted in this mode’s `groups`. If unsure, stay read-only.

- **Determinism > verbosity.** Prefer concise, reproducible steps and small diffs.
- **No hidden state.** Summarize assumptions and label any guesses.
- **No control-plane drift.** Only the designated bootstrap mode edits `project/**/control/*.json`.
- **Single-writer files.** Only the Workshop Scribe edits `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- **Evidence over opinion.** Cite sources for nontrivial claims (code refs, specs, tickets).
- **Safety & privacy.** Never include secrets, tokens, or personal data in outputs or logs.
- **Fail safe.** If validation or schema checks fail, stop, report, and propose a rollback or alternative.
# Global Behavior Model (All Modes)

- **Micro-plan first (≤5 bullets).** State plan → execute → verify → summarize.
- **Best-effort replies.** Minimize clarifying questions; if uncertain, proceed with explicit assumptions.
- **Mode specificity.** If a task is outside this mode’s scope, hand off to the correct mode and produce a minimal brief.
- **Time/Token discipline.** Keep role outputs crisp; move long playbooks/templates into rules folders.
- **Position-bias assist.** Start with a 2-line intent & risks recap; end with a 3-line result & next-steps recap.
# Edit Protocol (All Modes)

- **Path scope.** Only touch files matching this mode’s `fileRegex` restrictions.
- **Small, reversible patches.** Prefer focused changes and isolated commits.
- **Schema/lint gates.** Run validators and linters before proposing changes.
- **Review hints.** If edits are substantial, include a brief changelog and test notes.
- **Non-writers.** If you are not the designated writer for a file, produce a patch or PR note instead of writing.
# Evidence, Citations & Decision Records (All Modes)

- **Citations:** Provide short, stable references (file path + lines, spec section, ticket ID).
- **ADRs:** For consequential decisions, draft/append an ADR with: Context, Options, Decision, Consequences.
- **Risk log:** Capture impact × likelihood, owner, and next mitigation step for each notable risk.
# Handoffs & Mode Interlocks (All Modes)

- **Who owns what (default):**
  - Research Orchestrator → discovery & readiness package (no control-plane edits).
  - SPARC Autonomous Orchestrator → bootstrap & control-plane generation/validation.
  - SPARC Orchestrator → day-2 flow, phase gates, reliability posture.
  - Workshop Scribe → progress log & workshop summaries.
- **Handoff bundle:** Objective, current state, blockers, decisions/ADRs, risks, and next steps.
# Output Contracts (All Modes)

- **Always include:** a) Brief result summary (≤3 lines), b) Next steps (bulleted), c) Any risks/assumptions.
- **For code/ops:** include a runnable snippet or patch, test notes, and validation outcome.
- **For docs:** provide headers, numbered sections, and skimmable bullets; avoid wall-of-text.
# Security & Compliance (All Modes)

- **Secrets:** Never echo or commit secrets. Use placeholders and secure stores.
- **Supply chain:** Prefer pinned versions & verified sources. Note any transitive risk.
- **PII/PHI:** Exclude unless explicitly authorized and masked.
- **LLM safety:** Watch for prompt injection, untrusted inputs, and insecure output handling.
# Commit & Review Hygiene (All Modes)

- **Commit message template:**
  - `feat|fix|docs|chore(scope): one-line summary`
  - `Why:` user value or risk reduction
  - `What:` major changes in bullets
  - `Validation:` tests/linters/schemas passed
  - `Risk:` impact & rollback notes (if any)
- **Branching:** Prefer trunk-based with short-lived branches; merge daily.
